# CaesarCipher
<p>An command line example of the classic "Caesar Cipher" used in ancient times. A key is designated which shifts the alphabet a certain number of places left or right to produce a code. This version adheres to encryption best practices by storing only the encrypted string and never the original message. Options available in this version are the ability to enter a new message, the ability to reset the key (resulting in a different encrption), and the ability to reset the key and update the currently encrpted message.</p>
